# Issues reporting  
We are developing depthai framework, and it's crucial for us to know what kind of problems users are facing.  
Remember, the more information you give us, the faster we will help you and make depthai better!  
  
Please, do the following steps:  
1. Run script `log_system_information.sh` and provide us the output (`log_system_information.txt`, it's system version & modules versions);  
2. Take a photo of a device you are using (or provide us a device model);  
3. Describe the expected results;  
4. Describe the actual running results (what you see after started your script with depthai);  
5. Provide us information about how you are using the depthai python API (code snippet, for example);  
6. Send us consol outputs;
